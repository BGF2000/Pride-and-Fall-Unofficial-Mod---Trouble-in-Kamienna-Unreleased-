 POLITICS_MAZGULA_DESC:0 "It is no surprise that there were many soldiers in the Polish Army who didn't look up to Law and Justice - especially after its third "victory" in the elections. One of them was Adam Mazguła - a scoutmaster and a social activist heavily opposing authoritarian government.\n\nAfter resigning in 2017 as both a protest and a must, his carrier would circle around supporting the liberal Civic Platform and rallying in Nysa. However that all changed once PiS achieved its monopoly. He was imprisoned for "threating the internal security of Third Polish Republic". In prison he would further spread his agenda through the Internet and books he wrote during his stay in Końskie.\n\nAnd thanks to the likes of centrists who let him command the army he once again could relax and prepare for the invasion of the northern territories...\n\n...at least that was the plan before Law and Justice once again took power in the Holy Cross. Feeling flabbergasted and furious he organised an uprising against Paweł Rogowski and declared the new government as "illegitimate". Of course Oskar Rogowski has come to an agreement with both Gabriel Kwietniak and Mazguła himself and let the former take control of the region once the dust settled. However whether they will get to implement that is another question in itself."
