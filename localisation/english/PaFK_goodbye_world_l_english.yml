 PaFK_BGF_WIP_TEXT: "...or so it would seem. But the fact is that this is a demo for an (hopefully - if my motivation keeps me going) upcoming unofficial addition to \"Pride and Fall\" mod. In its current state it's an unfinished piece of work with very little graphics and lore included in it (at least for me). Also I am not a talented writer and feel like some of the description could do some rework. In the meantime however I will try to improve some of these problems.\n\nIf you want to help with the development of said mod you can send any advice or bug report (or even graphics, because quite frankly I suck at it). All of these are greatly appreciated and will be remembered fondly.\nThanks in advance." # Please do
 PaFK_BGF_SD_ENDING_TEXT: "Kinga Wnuk actually thought she could create a new society in the place of a broken one. The one which had lost hope for true freedom and security from outside elements such as terrorism. The one which opposed her rule and yet she continued on. The one which just wanted a better future...\n\nOh how wrong she was.\n\nNot only the civilians were full of unrest but also its representatives - the party members who advocated for true Progressive State. With all might united against Kinga the government effectively took control over the nation. However not everyone stood silently whilst watching everything unfold. And these people are trying to destabilise Poland as much as possible. Whatever future this state holds, it is anything but peaceful." # Literally PiS

The one which had lost hope for true freedom and security from outside elements such as terrorism. The one which opposed her rule and yet she continued on. The one which just wanted a better future...\n\nBut what do you know? It actually succeeded.\n\nWith basically no other saving grace Kinga Wnuk effectively became a dictator ruling with a copper fist - not as harsh, but still painful. With no opposition to denounce her, every single Pole, Ukrainian and Russian must bend to her will, even if it's ridiculuous. As unfortunate as it is, there is only one group to blame - the Progressives for allowing this to happen in the first place. Even if they didn't expect this to happen..." # Dang you, centre-left
 PaFK_BGF_KWIETNIAK_ENDING_TEXT: "Welcome to the 40s Poland. A country which is still recovering from the mess caused by Law and Justice back in the 20s. Many people died, and even more have been scarred for the rest of their life. And yet not everything that happened was in vain. Luckily for the Poles a better future awaits - under the rule of Civic Coalition. All thanks to one fellow named Gabriel Kwietniak.\n\nHaving seen the sheer damage and experienced it himself, he dedicated all of his forces and money into helping the ones in need. Now that the country is at peace the process of true reunification and defalsification can begin. The road to achieve this will be shaky, but once Poland is there nothing can stop her progress." # Long live liberal Poland
 PaFK_BGF_GORCZYNSKI_ENDING_TEXT: "It is no surprise to anyone when they see a person return to his roots. After all they were with them the longest and served them - for the better or for worse. That is the case with Jarosław Górczyński - a new president of Poland.\n\nWhere once ruled harmony and peace now reigns corruption and fear. Despite the president's best efforts to not give in the temptations and bribes he eventually succumbed to them. Thus leading the newly-reborn country into disarray again. It seems as if Poland will repeat the modern history of Russia - a promising democracy falling into oligarchy and then dictatorship.\n\nBut now the EU would not sit idly through this. If, by some chance, Górczyński had plans to expand his power and reign the organisation would intervene. It learned from its mistake - §Cand won't repeat it again...§!" # If only they did the same to other dictators...
 PaFK_BGF_KACZOR_ENDING_TEXT: "They say family is the closest bond to whom you can really have. And yet the truth here is disturbingly different. And one person in particular knows it the best...\n\nOskar Rogowski tried to follow in the footsteps of Szymon Hołownia, establishing a centre-leftist regime where everyone's voice could be heard. Where everyone could live in harmony. Unfortunately for him, his godfather thought unlike, causing a coup d'etat. Paweł Rogowski broke the sacred rule of the Commonwealth - to never let PiS rule again. He reestablished state television with hints of propaganda mainly targetted at Donald Tusk. He delegalised abortion and free speech - under harsh penalties. He repeated the steps to total control over Poland.\n\nAll of European nations look in horror as seemingly nothing has changed since 2015. §RAnd rightfully so.§!" # Imagine putting your godfather as a villian in "your" alternate history - couldn't be me!
 PaFK_BGF_ATEIZM_ENDING_TEXT: "Catholicism - a religion so closely related to Poland it seemed as if they fused together forever. And yet somehow it all turned around.\n\nMeet Łukasz Stolarek - the perpetrator responsible for all of the suffering caused in his country. He not only dismantled religion and abolished it - to surprise of many - but also brought back the terror known in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. Anyone who still believed in some sort of God has been tortured and dehumanised to the point of no return. Men were forced to conscript into the army unde rthe threat of death penalty. They wouldn't see the light of the day again. As for the women §Ra worse fate would await them...§!\n\nUnless some sort of miracle blesses Poland, its citizens can't expect anyone to fully liberate them from the madness of one atheist." # Atheist Poland? Pfft, that would never happen.
 PaFK_BGF_KOMUNA_ENDING_TEXT: "Some people still feel nostalgia towards the Polish People's Republic - either because they feel that \"these were the better times\" or they missed the careless lifestyle. Whatever the reason it is they can now celebrate. Today Poland is once again a communist nation - not by the will of the people of course.\n\nThe times where people waited in very long queues for basic products returned. And so the lack of commodities, harsh treatment at schools, abolishment of (most) basic human rights and the return of the Security Service. There are also rumours that the mafia plans to return as well, though it isn't confirmed yet. Whatever the case may be, the people who wished for PRL to come back can now celebrate...?\n\nOh, right. This is also illegal. Now what people? Are you happy due to this development? Or are you regretting your decision? §RANSWER ME!§!" # PRL war the worst thing to happen to our country (just after the Nazis)
 PaFK_BGF_CELSA_ENDING_TEXT: "Un verdadero mago nunca revela su secreto. Éste es el caso del ahora excesivamente presente conglomerado CELSA. Su objetivo era dominar el mercado polaco con el acero y el hierro.\n\nY lo logró.\n\nAhora casi todos los productos fabricados en este país están hechos de al menos un diez por ciento de hierro u otros elementos. No importa si se trata de comida, máquinas o incluso muebles. Se espera que cada ciudadano sepa español (no necesariamente polaco) y trabaje 12 horas al día en acerías patrocinadas por el gobierno. Nadie está a salvo de la locura del Conglomerado. Ni siquiera el resto de Europa, ya que los planes de conquista del continente se filtran día a día." # This Spanish text has been sponsored by Google Translate

 PaFK_BGF_DOOM_ENDING_TEXT: "All is lost now. A country which was destined to be reunited and somewhat prospering (even if very little). But now? It is impossible. All of Poland's citizens have been murdered and vanished. Countless centuries of history and traditions - gone in just 13 years. If someone were to even attempt to bring all of this back, it would just turn into Sisyphean work doomed to failure. It seems as if Destiny had other plans for the land of the Poles.\n\nInevitably other nations would annex parts of this \"nation\" into their territory directly. Conflicts would spring up left and right. The remaining survivors (if any) would be horrified.\n\nUnited Nations or other international organisations did nothing to stop this barbarious act. Now they stand in utter disbelief and try to put blame on each other. But all of this won't reverse the time - the time before Poland fell in 2027." # ...
