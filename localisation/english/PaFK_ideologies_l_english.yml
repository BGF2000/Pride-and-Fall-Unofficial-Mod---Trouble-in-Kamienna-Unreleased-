 ### OPISY SUBIDEOLOGII

 socialdemocrature_centrist_democracy_subtype_desc:0 "It can't be denied that many forms of democracy have their own flaws - be it rampant corruption or instability. However Oskar Rogowski had tried to perfect the art of \"People's Government\" during his exile in Dresden, Germany. He called it Direct Centrist Democracy (or Polish-Swiss Democracy), though Bystronism is way more popular of a name.\n\nAccording to his manifest people will have the same power as in Switzerland but also avoid political extremes. This might seem impossible on paper, however in practice there would be implemented measures which would prevent such things from happening.\n\nThat idea would at least somewhat function without major hiccups in Western Europe. However whether it will workout in Poland is another topic, as many natives portray Rogowski as a \"foreign agent\" - due to him being forced to leave Poland on 8th of July 2024 by the decree of PiS' chairman Jarosław Kaczyński. This - combined with hatred towards Western culture and everything - could cause some people to defy this man's ambitions..."
 socialdemocrature_national_coalition_subtype_desc:0 "It can't be denied that many forms of democracy have their own flaws - be it rampant corruption or instability. However Oskar Rogowski had tried to perfect the art of \"People's Government\" during his exile in Dresden, Germany. He called it Direct Centrist Democracy (or Polish-Swiss Democracy), though Bystronism is way more popular of a name.\n\nAccording to his manifest people will have the same power as in Switzerland but also avoid political extremes. This might seem impossible on paper, however in practice there would be implemented measures which would prevent such things from happening.\n\nAnd this time, now that he controls his home country, he will make sure that Poland will not repeat its mistake from 2015. Thanks to discontent amongst the ranks in Kinga Wnuk's government and unity in trying to fix this nation, he can implement ideas which he wrote back in 2025. But considering the circumstances, this type of democracy is also intermixed with liberal and free-market ideologies. Whether this coalition will succeed in their goal is still up to debate."
 marxism_cranism_mafia_subtype_desc:0 "One day a fellow from Kunów has decided that the world didn't have enough of mafias (especially in Italy) and combined the ideologies of communism and the idea of southern Italian gang groups. His name was Filip Wójcik and he would go on to revolutionise criminality in Poland.\n\nCommunist Mafianism is not stricte an ideology, but rather a group of ideologies which don't see internal stability as necessary. Their goal is to get rich as fast as possible and in as brutal way as manageable. In terms of long-term goals they don't have any. Because of this most of mafiaist states like these quickly fall into anarchy.\n\nWhether Filip Wójcik's clique somehow turns Poland into a semi-ruleable place or not is still in question. However one can be sure that if their region gets conquered by Comafiaists (as they called themselves in Kunów) they had better follow the rules of their new rulers. Otherwise they will be met with brutality - only seen during World War 2 and done by SS-men."
 reactionary_nostalgism_subtype_desc:0 "Ah, Nostalgia. Something we all (will) experience one day. Whether be it while doing some sort of chore, during a test or even in some situations we might not want them to appear. No matter where and when, nostalgia reminds us of better times - the times when we didn't have to care about anything (mostly). And this sense of carelessness has made its way into politics.\n\nNostalgism is a subtype of reactionarism - but don't let that deceive you. While reactionary ideology seeks to bring back a form of government which is either ineffective or repressing, nostalgism is the opposite. It seeks human development on sociological level, bringing back \"the good-old days\" and sense of freedom in general. Though one of its aspects makes some spectators and experts sceptic towards nostalgism - and that is encouraging Poles to drop interest in the politics. This is an integral part of Polish society and removing it might result not only in power-hungry ideas of the government but also the (dis)uniting factor which in return united groups of Poles with the same views on social problems.\n\nWhatever nostalgia brings Poland we might not know. But perhaps it IS a better way for this nation to develop - not only thorugh technology but social interactions and better treatment of mental diseases."
 postpolonism_biolchem_subtype_desc:0 "The subjects known as Biology and Chemistry are very important when it comes to human development. They can tell us how we should live and different ways we can cure a patient. However what happens when these two are combined with radicalism and lack of human empathy? Well, you should ask Katerina Sosedko... if you are able to, of course.\n\nDue to forced relocation to Poland and continued education there Sosedko gained some \"interesting\" views regarding human nature and their importance when it comes to sole existence. Add in the hatred towards people like Gabriel Kwietniak and Oskar Rogowski and you have a disasterous ideology born from two subjects that shouldn't be darwinised in any way.\n\nIn practice this also means that everyone not careful enough might find themselves operanted on thorium and be injected hemp into arteries. Any form of opposition to the rule of Katerina could be considered a death wish, as she despises any form of critisism." # I TO się nazywa kobiecość! (jk)
 autocracy_mountain_generalism_subtype_desc:0 "The eight stages of genocide:\n\n1. Classification\n\n2. Symbolisation\n\n3. Dehumanisation\n\n4. Organiastion\n\n5. Polarisation\n\n6. Organisation\n\n§R7. Extermination§!\n\n8. Denial\n\n\nAll of those points should give you an idea of what to expect from Mountain General's regime."

 hero_subtype_desc:0 "When you come from a pretty peaceful town somewhere in America you don't really know how it feels like to live on any other continent. After all - why should you bother with politics or international conflicts if it doesn't influence you? However some of intelligentsia living in the Faraway Town have a different view on this issue.\n\nAccording to them it is important to develop yourself in every direction - whether sociological or geopolitical path. Education plays a key role in their lives, and it should as well in yours. However that doesn't mean that it only focuses on science. It depicts liberalism as a tool for oligarchs and a way to erode childhood in everyone's life. Yes, this type of socialism is also related to nostalgism.\n\nAnd yet this talk is very unpopular in Poland itself. Due to countless years of anti-socialist and anti-communist propaganda the people living in this country are uneager to relive these years - even if Faraway socialism is closer to progressive or technocratic ideals. It would require huge amounts of funds to change the situation around and even then it is unsure how much it would change."
 orange_joe_subtype_desc:0 "Everyone has a right to like a certain drink. Everyone has a right to recommend it to their friends and neighbours. But no one is allowed to force it down upon a person under the threat of killing somebody. And yet there is one human in particular that doesn't understand the latter. His name is Kel and he would love to make everyone drink Orange Joe.\n\nOrange Joe liberalism is not an ideology of liberalism, as the name would suggest, but rather the cult of Orange Joe - a drink consisting of orange juice and coffee mixed. Many people dislike it for its taste and the similarities with expired drinks. However that doesn't stop Kel from bringing in his deathsquads of \"Joeists\" and \"Oragneses\" and forcing it upon everyone. He will not stop until every Pole and minority living in Poland starts drinking Orange Joe and never stops.\n\nThis movement has also brought the attention of Kel's former friends and Hero - his brother. All of them consider Kel as a threat to Polish sovereignty and culture. Thus they are trying their best to stop this menace before it spreads too far."

 autocracy_truth_subtype_desc:0 "Depending on what type of truth you're talking about, it can either shape a human or destroy him (or her). Either way, in this nation truth is of absolute importance. Because without it it will fall apart.\n\nAt least that is what the government is trying to say. In reality it is all but truthful. The country is filled to the brim with criminal activities and questions yet to be answered. No one is safe from the madness of [ROOT.GetLeader]. In fact they are more prone to succumbing to its claws of deceivement." # Wartałoby dodać więcej opisu, ale nie chce mi się tego wszystkiego pisać :/
