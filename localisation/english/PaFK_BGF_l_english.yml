 BGF_anti_zero_uprising_desc:0 "Zbigniew Ziobro is, to say the least, a horrible human being. His methods of torture and ruthless prosecutorship have not helped with improving his image. The amount of our people that have lost hope in any freedom has seemingly vanished. It all seemed to be lost...\n\nUntil one day. That was when one (now) famous person named Kinga Wnuk has declared Ziobro's State to be "illegitimate and undesirable" and declared an open revolt. Although her campaign to restore order in the Holy Cross Region seemed to be designated for success (especially after taking Kielce for a brief moment), it all turned around after the battle of Wet Mountains (Góry Mokre) when Wnuk and her commanders lost half of their fighting force.\n\nBut thankfully other revolts sprung up around Starachowice and Sandomierz, effectively saving northern Holy Cross from total annihillation. Don't be fooled - the fight is still ongoing, but with enough determination we might just push Zbigniew and his confidants out of our lands.\n\n§GThe End is Near§!"
 BGF_fight_for_freedom_desc:0 "No more shall we live in fear of getting arrested for basically nothing. No more shall we live under some maniac's boot. And no more shall we stand idly when people are clearly calling for help! We have demonstrated it by helping the victims of the resulting war and granting much-needed liberties (of course the ones that we felt were necessary). However our job is far from done. There are still civilians that can't enjoy our rule due to countless of repressions used by Zbigniew Ziobro. That is why we NEED to fight!\n\nNo matter the cost."
 BGF_no_more_compromise_desc:0 "General Prosecutorship has to be one of the most evil states (at the time of writing this) that broke up from Third Polish Republic. Their ruthlessness and eagerness to commit atrocities have proven themselves true especially during our uprising. That is why we are spreading a special slogan - [BGF_no_more_compromise]! And we will fight until the bitter end to prove it.\n\nUnfortunately some people aren't as determined to adhere to this parole as we wanted. For these kinds of semi-deserters we have a unique tactical advantage - Ziobro's nature. His brutal reign of terror should be enough to cause shiers down anyone's spine. And if that doesn't work, nothing will."
 BGF_a_right_revolt_desc:0 "Despite what PiS-men and the Prosecutor say, our revolt has been recognised as a valid response to unlawness by many foreign leaders. This not only fueled our determination, but also caused a surge of conscripts to sign in into the army. Because they know that they're fighting for a good cause.\n\nBut funnily enough there has been an equal amount of countries putting down our war of liberation as "useless slaughter" and "unreasonable fight". Whilst we can agree on some of their points of view, the majority have been completely made up for propaganda purposes. We can't (and won't) tolerate these lies. That's why their voices will be limited - even if it means eroding our freedom of speech..."
 BGF_cooperate_with_others_desc:0 "Although we have controlled the territories of Sandomierz and Starachowice for a considerable amount of time we eventually had to give them up due to problems arising in our provisional capital. These actions sprung up another revolts - this time targetted not only against Ziobro, but us too. Thankfully we reached a temporary agreement on said issue which combined our forces in order to deport Prosecutorship from Holy Cross.\n\nOur point here is that we can't be selfish and only fight for our cause. Sure, we will eventually fight against these warlords, but for the time being we can buy time and prepare for eventual war. But what is actually important he is a common goal - freedom from oppressive regime. And that is what Bodzechów Accord includes - which no one can deny.\n\nSo to all sons and daughters of Świętokrzyskie - fight for your and our freedom!"
 BGF_supply_soldiers_desc:0 "Weapons are difficult to come by in these troubling times and it seems as if it is the best of times to use our hidden stockpiles. Their purpose was to supply our soldiers when the hardest of times - that is, near total collapse of our rebellion - came. And while we're not faring as badly as we thought we would their importance can't be denied. Thus we are comfortable to use them to fill in missing equipment in our army.\n\nWill it cost us everything in the long run? Absolutely not.\nIs it necessary? Probably.\nWill it help us fight better? Obviously.\n\nSo what are we waiting for? Let us use them to their fullest advantage!"
 BGF_hooray_desc:0 "Thanks to our determination and cooperation with other revolts we managed to push Zbigniew Ziobro out of the Northern Counties (or Powiats). With this achievement in our hands, we are sure to cause some trouble in General Prosecutorship. But as long as it causes the whole region to become free (or even some parts of Lesser Poland) this is much expected from us.\n\nThis push is definitely worth a worthy celebration in Ostrowiec. Let this be known to everyone that we won't bend under anyone's knee - not even under the threat of failure."

 BGF_back_from_dead_desc:0 "How did we get here? How, despite our best efforts and combined arms with other warlords, did we fail to secure our freedom? But even more confusing is how we managed to rise back unscathed? But I guess sometimes there is no answer to a question. Just confusion.\n\nNo matter. Zbigniew Ziobro is still alive. And he's still repressing our fellow citizens of Holy Cross. We must take as much land as possible from him. Thankfully due to several reasons his army had collapsed - making our job in return simpler.\n\n§0And so begins our another adventure on the "frontlines".§!"
 BGF_no_mercy_for_him_desc:0 "After we had lost and bended under the pressure of guns and artillery we expected everyone to live AT LEAST without the fear of getting killed for minor offences. We even pleaded to Him (of all people) to reconsider his stance on prosecuting people.\n\nBut it seems that this request has fallen into deaf ears...\n\nNot even one day after the collapse of united front did our citizens feel "better". Instead they realised that §Rnothing has changed at all§!. Zbigniew Ziobro once again began to shoot onto protesters and imprison them. Entire families were sent to work camps for not fulfilling requests of local militias.\n\nThus it is of upmost importance to send Ziobro and his pack of "wolves" cowering back to Lesser Poland in order to get slaughtered even there. §RThere is no other option!§!"
 BGF_until_death_do_us_part_desc:0 "Understandably we will all have to die at some point. Either as a nation, human being or even the entire world. But not even this process shall make Ostrowiec and Olkusz (or Kielce) friends. §9Don't even think about it.§!\n\nWhat they have done to us can't repair our relations ever. Sure, we have forgived Germans for this. But it required them to realise that they have messed up and apologise to us. Also they weren't our brethrens. But in the case of General Prosecutorship it's the complete opposite.\n\nIf we were to enter hell for some reason, at least we would make a favourable reference to Zbigniew Ziobro ruling it with a magma fist. Even if he weren't to do that."
 BGF_hooray_zibro_desc:0 "What we have achieved can be barely called a "victory". Sure, we have received our long-awaited independence as a democratic nation. But not only have we lost lands now belonging to other warlords but also our spirit is completely shattered. No one believes that we will be able to reunite the whole region under our rule. No one dares to think that there is some sort of salvation.\n\n§CBut there is still one option...§!\n\nWe will send invitations to other leaders of Holy Cross and begin unification negociations. Whether this will work out for us is still up for debate but maybe... just maybe... §Cwe will see something blessed happen.§!"

 BGF_celebrations_in_ostrowiec_desc:0 "After countless days of onslaught from Końskie, Busko-Zdrój and other Prosecutorship's cities we can now rest peacefully. For we have achieved what probably not even Zbigniew Ziobro thought we would. A victory over his forces - albeit a forced one due to the depleting supplies on both sides. But whatever - we can now celebrate our new-found victory and independence in Ostrowiec. Let us also invite our neighbours with whom we might not have the best relations. That way, perhaps, we might come to an agreement with them and later annex their territories."
 BGF_now_for_the_real_work_desc:0 "Tragedy! Our event, which was planned to host the leadership not only from our city but also Starachowice and Sandomierz, is now considered a fiasco. With several dead and the celebration not going as planned in general we haven't achieved what we had promised to the hard-working people of our Commonwealth. Now we are sure to have to fight with others for the unification of the voivodeship.\n\nBut no matter. Because even then there are those who denounce our rule which have sprung up from the Prosecutorship's former territories. We would have to figth nonetheless. But it's still tragic that we need to spill more Polish blood.\n\n§RHowever that is not the only issue plaguing our nation.§!"
 BGF_the_path_to_war_desc:0 "Now that we have restored every sector of our country back to its prime, we can now focus on our neighbours. There are many different sides to this conflict (and we may have already fought some of them due to how slow our progress was). That is why there are many methods we can use to achieve our goal - a united Holy Cross. But probably the most complicated and varied subject that is still up to date is how we should deal with the leadership of the conquered territories. But I guess it depends on who we will fight, doesn't it?"
 # Cywile
 BGF_restore_civilian_infrastructure_desc:0 "It is no surprise to anyone when we tell them that our country is one of the poorest in the entire Poland. Despite being more developed that our neighbours (yes, even in Radom region), our GDP per capita has drastically fallen ever since the war with General Prosecutorship. This, combined with previous socio-economical problems encountered in Ostrowiec and neighbouring areas before the Fall, makes our situations... peculiar to say the least. It would require huge amount of time and effort to reverse the scars and even develop ourselves."
 BGF_repair_roads_desc:0 "The roads in our voivodeship are things we should be ashamed of. Not only do they frequently break down but also are very limited. There are rarely any alternate passages for trucks to drive through. Also we shouldn't forget about the World War 2 mines that are still present but hidden under layers of concrete.\n\nAll of these factors lead to one conclusion - we should repair and improve our roads so that we won't be a laughing stock of Poland."
 BGF_focus_on_quality_desc:0 "Quality can't be truly replaced with quantity. If you had to choose between 12 T-34 tanks and 4 M1 Abrams, which one would be the weapon of your choice? Sure, there would be more T-34s to shoot. But for how long would they last against the improved designs of M1s?\n\nThat's my point - without technological advantage we will be nothing. Of course the importance of quantity can't be denied. It's just that relying only on numbers won't get you anywhere far as technology would. Just look at United States - the military force to be reckoned with. The nation whose scientists are a prime example to be followed by.\n\nThankfully we have enough experienced people as well as young scientists who are willing to spend their lives to improving our country - one step at a time."
 BGF_focus_on_quantity_desc:0 "As one famous person once said "Quantity is a quality in a sense". There have been many examples of that being the case around the history. Even now we can find that out in the products we use every day. So why shouldn't we try this exact thing? After all, with a bigger force we will be able to unite Poland fully (and make it great again).\n\nBut let's take one step at a time. Currently we still have some stockpiles left after the uprising was concluded. We shall use these weapons to arm our forces so that they won't have to fight with bare hands against guns and axes."
 BGF_computer_in_every_house_desc:0 "Computers are a wonderful invention. Thanks to them the bureaucracy and access to information have improved drastically. Especially with ever-so-developing and -growing Internet market and cryptocurrency. Yes, there are hiccups (like Windows 11's fiasco and Windows 12's major failure) and dangers related to them (like a cyberattack on Estonia back in the 90s), but they are neglectable at least.\n\nWe will implement a program called "Computer in Every House". This will allow families to own at least one workstation (or a laptop according to their needs) and learn again how to use them properly. Because an educated and talented society is better than traditionalist and catholic community."
 BGF_tv_in_every_house_desc:0 "Televisions have evolved for a long time - usually transforming throughout the years. First used as a source of information now has many other purposes like entertainment. Of course, they can also be used to manipulate society and polarise it (as we know it far too well from the example of TVP), but if we guarantee freedom of speech and clear view on everything we will be able to prevent such outcome.\n\nWe will implement a program called "Television in Every House". This will allow families to own at least one television set with a decoder and access to the most vital programs. Because an informed and truthful nation is better than propagandized and lied country."
 BGF_the_work_is_done_civ_desc:0 "Despite many setbacks met on our way, we were able to carry through and even develop from our experiences. Now our society is more than satisfied and wealthy. Not only that - we could allow ourselves to expand our army and propagate free lessons on vital knowledge such as using a computer or avoiding propaganda. All of these have allowed us to build a new, more egalitarian society which will survive throughout the crises and collapses."
 # Militaria.pl
 BGF_restore_military_infrastructure_desc:0 "While we have the largest army in the Holy Cross, there is still an option that our title will befall onto someone else. That's because of our defeatism and lack of development compared to some warlords.\n\nTo be honest, it isn't that surprising considering that we have gained and lost so much land to other warlords which have a higher morale. But why should we not? We still helped in dismantling Ziobrite realm and freeing (to some extent) our brethren in the region.\n\nWe should bring these points up to our society and remind them who started the fire of uprisings across the Prosecutorship."
 BGF_look_through_trash_desc:0 "During our costly war with General Prosecutorship we were able to smuggle and keep some of the weapons later used in the actual battle. They have proven especially useful when we were lacking equipment. But now that such stockpile, which was hidden, has no more use a question raises - what should we do with the guns and axes?\n\nThe simple answer is to keep them in case a war was to break out. But let's be honest, we will have to fight (or we fight right now) soon enough. That's why we shall use these stockpiles to arm our army (or deploy more divisions)."
 BGF_more_meatshields_desc:0 "The more men we have in our army the better the chance we will have in winning our early wars. They are probably the most important in shaping our industry and whatnot. If we don't have enough arms we will fall - sooner or later. That is why we are encouraging more people to enter the armed forces - so that they won't have to be forcefully enlisted at the beginning of a conflict. Otherwise chaos would erupt - and we don't want that to happen."
 BGF_better_weapons_desc:0 "Nothing beats numerical advantage as much as technological one. Thanks to it we can kill our enemies more accurately and with less chances of them surviving or dodging. That also means that we can let our soldiers equip better armour and camoflauge. But before we can start implementing our ideas into reality there is one major caution that we feel must be addressed...\n\nNumerical advantage is not as significant if your army is slightly smaller but better equipped. However when the disproportion is too large, the technology can't really save you from the onslaught of angry Poles. That is why we are still prioritising improved conscription laws so that we won't have to suffer later on."
 BGF_blast_from_the_past_desc:0 "When our homeland has fallen to the occupiers during World War 2 an organisation called Union of Armed Struggle began to fight against them. In 1942 it was replaced by Home Army known mostly for the organisation of Warsaw Uprising. But that was not the only thing these two achieved between 1939 and 1945. They have done MUCH more than that.\n\nBesides instigating minor uprisings and sabotaging occupiers, they have held the morale of the people which made Poles one of the only nations not to collaborate en masse. Also they combatted germanisation efforts (such as keeping Polish monuments intact) and used various methods to annoy the Germans (thus the famous "Only swines sit at the cinema").\n\nWe shall follow their example and make sure that the enemy will have a hell of a time trying to keep their newly-found territories compliant."
 BGF_technologie_uber_alles_desc:0 "After the fall of communism in Poland one of the upmost of priorities was entering North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. An organisation hellbent on protecting liberties (which is rightfully questioned nowadays) and spreading democracy (with instability). It symbolised the free West fighting against the authoritarian East.\n\nBut when we look at NATO we don't really analyse their failures and them breaking international laws. We are mainly focusing on military aspects and technological developments begun by the nations belonging to it. They have proven themselves not only modern but also effective at eliminating armed forces (although they clearly have a lot of trouble with partisans). This is why we shall copy these tactics and decimate our enemies while keeping our casualties low."
 BGF_the_work_is_done_mil_desc:0 "Now that we have developed our armed forces into something worth applauding, we can start focusing on other aspects of our nation. Because quite frankly there is still some work to do - be it improving our country even more or finally reuniting it under one banner. Whatever happens to us right now will decide whether the choices we have taken were truly right and now a mistake that will cost us our independence."
 # "Szkoła"
 BGF_restore_education_infrastructure_desc:0 "Our education system is absolutely terrible. Well, it's not because of Kinga Wnuk's fault. §g(Or is it?)§! If that were true then she would be already deposed by the party. The truth is that we lack resources and proper infrastructure.\n\nMost of our textbooks disappeared in unknown circumstances during the uprising. And those which are still left are mostly outdated. This problem caused more harm than we expected. But there are even more problems besides this one.\n\nAlmost every school is returning to the early 2000s as they bring back chalkboards and old tables and chairs. But even then the shortages of aforementioned items are an often sighting. The teachers are mostly conservative and politicised.\n\nAll of these issues are hampering our progress and must be dealt with as soon as possible."
 BGF_print_new_textbooks_desc:0 "As we mentioned earlier our textbooks are outdated. They no longer contain current and proper information, and most of them are politicised to extreme. We can't let the schools use them for education. What will they teach our young minds besides nonsense and improper facts? Nothing.\n\nThis is why we should employ two of "our" biggest textbook companies - "Nowa Era" (New Era) and "Wydawnictwa Szkolne i Pedagogiczne" (School and Pedagogical Publications). They will make sure that no more ideology shall be imposed on students just because some paranoid cat owner said so. At least in theory..."
 BGF_everyone_is_equal_desc:0 "Despite Kinga Wnuk believing that everyone should do their best and not "slack off", the truth is that not everyone is able to compete on such a scale. There are people who just can't learn as much as others due to either problems with health or just different views on something. She may not see it that way, but the party does.\n\nBefore 2019 there functioned a well-working system of gymnasiums and liceums. Those who had problems with taking information and remembering it went to the former. The rest of the students however started their further education in the latter. This made sure that even the most untalented had a chance at improving - even slightly. Thus we should restore that system and hope that it makes a difference - somehow..."
 BGF_put_pressure_on_intelligentsia_desc:0 "How can someone believe that in order to become a technocracy one's society has to be fully educated? Yes, that part of country's structure is massively important. But you just have to put focus on the most intelligent and talented students so that they can later work for our nation. You can't seek your attention on both them and the rest of pupils.\n\nEven when we try to appease the parents there will be THOSE students who just refuse to comply. They will not care whether they get to graduate to the next class or not. It just makes my blood boil when I think about it.\n\n*sigh* Oh well... At least there will be no objection to my proposal, I hope."
 BGF_focus_on_science_desc:0 "Konrad Łebek, one of the most vocal figures when it comes to development, recently voiced his worries regarding the regression in the intelligence of our population. According to the studies carried out by independent organisations our society's knowledge has degraded throughout the 4 years after 2023 elections. It may not be surprising on paper, but in practice the facts that they have forgotten leaves much to be desired. For example some men believe that using contraceptives makes them more prone to catching AIDS, while the women use... potatoes instead of tampons just because they are "more ecologically friendly and release less CO2 into the athmosphere".\n\nWell... with these results we have come into an unanimous conclusion: something has to be done. With our improvements in education system currently going through the voting we should in the meantime grant more funds to science."
 BGF_focus_on_history_desc:0 ""Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it."\n\nWith these words we shall remind everyone what happens when you don't learn from your past mistakes and instead repeat them - just in a different form.\n\nAfter introducing "History and Modernity" into the curriculum of the students of liceums, Law and Justice stopped putting effort into making history actually true and instead changed it to make it fit into their narrative. This could ensure that people such as Donald Tusk or Oskar Rogowski were to remain as agents forever in the minds of Poles. This, in return, caused significant damage to our perception of truth and false. Was Christopher Columbus actually a Pole? Did Nicholas Copernicus write a thesis on how Germans destroy Poland from the inside? How did Józef Piłsudski manage to write an anthem by himself?\n\nAll of these questions come from lack of historical knowledge. Thus we must spread the truth and reverse the damage done by Przemysław Czarnek and his friends at MEiN."
 BGF_the_work_is_done_edu_desc:0 "Thankfully we have managed to revitalise our education sector even thoguh it appeared to be harder to resolve. With this major victory we have secured great reputation in the eyes of teachers and parents alike. Also, just before ending our work on said branch, we made secularism mandatory in every school. Now our pupils won't have to be forced to partake in religious practices - especially if they believe in a different religion. Truly wonderful!"

 POLITICS_KINGA_WNUK_DESC:0 "Back in 2003, when Poland was still united, a certain person by the name of Kinga Wnuk, along with her colleagues, decided to create a private preschool in Ostrowiec, in which children would be able to happily get along and learn important life skills, such as communication. She named it "Promyk". Then, a few years later, a primary school and a liceum would open - both named after Stanisław Konarski, a person which was responsible for the reform of Polish education.\n\nEverything seemed to go smoothly ever since, until 2024 when the principal was forced to close all of the facilities due to a local governor's report on "indoctrination" and "falsification of history". After this unfortunate event, Wnuk would work as a tutor in Kielce until the §RBałuty incident.§!\n\nUnder Ziobro's Prosecutorship many teachers have suffered - and no one can deny that. Because of this Kinga began a risky intiative of forming a resistance cell in her hometown of Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski. Several of her former students would join it as well, creating a foundation of a country known as the Ostrowiec Commonwealth.\n\nAll of these years have §Rdrastically§! changed her. From a somewhat loveable principal of one of the most praised schools she changed into a semi-paranoid leader. Due to this many people have worried about the developments the new state could experience were it to unify Poland. §ROnly God knows what will come out of this mixture of reformism and paranoia.§!"

 POLITICS_GABI_DESC:0 "Born in the late 2000s Gabriel Kwietniak may not have known how life used to be during the rule of Civil Platform (or Coalition). Nor will he ever know due to excessive propaganda spewed by Law and Justice to unsuspecting civillians. But what he definitely knows is that these times had been much better than between 2015 and 2027.\n\nAs a relatively young individual he became a member of the Youth Council of Ostrowiec with his older friend Armando. Although it wasn't his actual hometown (it was Kraków), he felt strong connections towards it. And so he began his career as an orator and a young promising politician.\n\nUnfortunately for him, Zbigniew Ziobro would not see these actions as "friendly" towards his plans of consolidating his rule in the Holy Cross region. And so he was imprisoned and forced to do harsh labour. The only saving grace for him were his former friends organising an uprising in the work camp and transferring him to Ostrowiec. There he began cooperating with Kinga Wnuk and ruling alongside her.\n\n§GBut of course, Destiny had other plans.§! After some time he noticed how his former had lost her mind and started purging everyone. Due to this factor, he felt forced to coup d'etat her government and install his own for the time being. Now he stands as a sole "president" (or "prime minister") of an infant nation. In which way will he steer it? How will it affect the people? Perhaps no one knows besides his closests confidants. But one thing is for sure - §Git will be better than Wnuk's madness.§!"

 POLITICS_CBA_DESC:0 "How does a president of a city turn from a beloved figure of the locals to a corrupt scum which takes bribes from his colleagues, and then back to the beginning? Well, it is quite frankly difficult to explain, but one thing is for sure - Jarosław Górczyński had a bit of a tenuous reputation.\n\nBorn in 1971 in Ostrowiec, this politician was one of the most respected people of said city. Modernising it and developing new driveways was one of his upmost priority. Due to his actions (and connection with the locals) many considered him as an ideal politician - one that wouldn't take things for granted.\n\nBut all of it changed in March of 2023 - the time when he was taking bribes worth 40 thousand złotys. The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau arrested him and put him in prison for 3 years. It seemed like his image was terribly tarnished from such act. After his early resignation Artur Łakomiec would continue his legacy of reforms and education grants.\n\nBut then, in 2026, he was abruptly assassinated by one fellow named Łukasz Stolarek. After this incident Jarosław found his second chance and took it without second thoughts. Even after the Fall he provided his citizens with care and hope. And when Anti-Ziobro Uprising began, he took arms and fought bravely, especially in Opatów and Sadowie. Now he rests peacefully for he knows he did a great job. But even then he must be careful - many dangers are lurking from within and without. If he takes one step too far his house of cards could fall apart and be taken by an even worse human being.\n\n§CEvery Ostrowczanin believes in him - don't mess it up.§!" # Dang, Łukasz. I hope you're not mad
 
 POLITICS_ATEIZM_DESC:0 "Łukasz Stolarek was not a religious person at all. Even from a young age he would avoid taking part in Religion lessons. After all - "Why should you believe in God when your life is a complete mess (and it doesn't get better at all)?" That thought began something which not even Łukasz would be able to explain in full detail and confidence.\n\nBut one day it provoked him to destroy a local church in Szewna and every statue containing any religious figure in there. Not only had he caused thousands of złotys of damage but this landed him straight into prison. It wouldn't be until 2027 when he would feel the taste of freedom once again. This time however he has other plans - far more radical than back in the "good old days". He would dismantle religion and force atheism onto everyone - and those who would not agree will meet a §Rscarring§! ending - especially women.\n\nBut before he can put his vision into reality he must conquer all of Poland. No one knows if this hooligan will actually manage to do this, but if he does §Rmay God protect the people of Poland - for they don't know what's coming down their way...§!"
 
 POLITICS_NAZBOL_DESC:0 "When one is joking around, he must be careful not to make it true. Otherwise he will actually believe in it and then cause a catastrophe as well. Unfortunately one Marcel Olejarczyk did not listen to this lesson and actually embraced §0National Bolshevism§! - a mixture of National Socialism and Bolshevism.\n\nBack in high school Marcel used to make semi-nazi jokes with his friend Gabriel. Although no one batted an eye on this as this was as common in Poland as human rights abuses during Law and Justice rule. However what no one knew at a time was that an alternate persona formed inside Marcel. At first it didn't control him directly but it all changed once he graduated. That was when one of his family members was killed by an immigrant in July of 2026. He felt his heart break into million pieces and his true personality vanish within a second.\n\nAfter this incident he made sure that once he would come to power §0Poland would be purified our of non-Poles and quasi-Poles§!. Although not much has happened that would cause reaction from international community (yet), Marcel Olejarczyk is waiting for the right moment - the moment his revenge would be fulfilled. §0Either with a healthy Poland or not.§!"

 POLITICS_BGF_DESC:0 "How does it feel to be denied citizenship and nationality by one madman who despised your stance so much he felt the need to dehumanise you? How does it feel to be disrespected by your peers from the moment you turned six? Perhaps no one knows this better than Oskar Rogowski - a person with great ambitions but horribly harsh personal history.\n\nBeing born in Lublin on 7th of July 2008 he had numerous signs of mental and physical health problems ever since he arrived in his hometown of Opatów (and later Ostrowiec). It didn't help the fact that almost no one seemed to try and befriend young Bystroń (except one time before going to liceum). His situation improved slightly after graduating from primary school - as a model for other students and an extreme introvert. The peers seemed to treat him a tad better but still far from his actual needs.\n\nAnd yet his entire life would turn upside-down. As a stauch anti-PiS activist he gathered the attention of Jarosław Kaczyński who decided that he should "return to his actual homeland of Germany - just like Donald Tusk". This caused him to be deported to Dresden where he would spend the rest of his exile up to April of 2027. During his stay he planned the way to reorganise the Polish government when the time has come. Unfortunately for him that chance wouldn't arrive.\n\nSubjugation of Western Polish territories, chaos in Holy Cross and anarchy everywhere else have changed Oskar Rogowski to the core. His hidden mental problems surfaced yet again and hope for a free Poland vanished. Even after taking power in Ostrowiec the people consider him nothing more than a puppet of von der Leyen or Navalny (or anyone else). He may not be able to turn the situation around, but he will do ANYTHING in his power to at least improve Holy Cross Region slightly.\n\nPerhaps one day the truth will come out...\n\n...and he will become another Nikola Tesla or Vincent van Gogh."
 POLITICS_BGF_HAPPY_DESC:0 "§CIt almost seems impossible.§!\n\nThe person who was made into an agent belonging to "foreign nations" was destined to be one for eternity. His life was supposed to be one giant tragedy which couldn't be reversed by anyone. And yet... §Cthanks to a childhood peer§! it all changed.\n\nAs a human who knows the best about discrimination and propaganda, Oskar Rogowski was always on a short end of a stick. Whether be it because of school bullying, fury caused by challenging one person from Żoliborz, it doesn't matter. What matters is that all of this have caused irreversible damage to mental health of Bystroń. Not even his broad knowledge could help him survive anywhere - not even in Germany or Czech Republic.\n\n§GBut thankfully these harsh times seem to be over. For good this time.§!\n\nNow Oskar is leading a coalition of socialdemocrats, centrists and liberals to clean up the mess caused by Kinga Wnuk. United in order to achieve this goal, this task will probably be easier to complete. And of course - it wouldn't happen if it wasn't for the determination of his friends and - of course - §4Her.§!"

 POLITICS_WSTYDZIOCH_DESC:0 "Dominika Mruk might be one of those people who shared a similiar fate with the person she both despised and loved discreetly - Oskar Rogowski. However the end result differed drasticaly between them. Because unlike him, Dominika regained most of her sanity and trust towards others. §RHowever that wasn't the case almost a decade ago.§!\n\nHaving been born in August of 2008 she was one of the last generations that experienced a truly modest and happy childhood. Except that didn't really happen. As she attended the Public Primary School no. 1 in Ostrowiec she had to contest with the jealous peers that would do §Ranything§! to get rid of competition for becoming a boyfriend of one of the people in her class. Despite the best efforts of teachers and said person she fell into anorexia which almost costed her life.\n\nAt this point one would think that her life was basically pointless - §9only suffering and nothing else.§! And yet something happened which not even her parents expected. After some time spent in a school named after Stanisław Konarski her §Cself-esteem§! restored fully and no longer seemed to care about other people's opinion. §CThis would majorly shape the newly-created personality of Mruk§! - including her perspective on life.\n\nHowever this sense of normalcy would end on 8th of July 2024, as the person that she wanted to date for so long got deported to Germany. This event would forever radicalise her and be a stepping stone for nostalgism - an ideology of the better past. Thankfully (until now) this process was hampered slightly by being denied the power to rule Poland. However with her ascension comes §0a new set of concerns§! such as possible formation of §Rdictatorship§! and §Rradicalisation§! of Poles in general.

But just before he could return to Záhorie he would be locked inside Ostrowiec Culture Brewery for an undefined amount of time. During this period he became even more radicalised and planned not only to kill all Hungarians but also to exterminate Poles.\n\nAfter the Man escaped from isolation he couldn't return to his homeland. Thus he changed his plans slightly - he would first murder Poland and then Hungary. Of course he would recruit those who deemed worthy of becoming Slovaks not only into the army but also the government. The rest would meet a §Rgruesome end to their life§!.\n\nWhatever happens from now on will decide whether Poland and Hungary will see another day... §0or not.§!"

It was a bloody campaign but a successful one. The only saving grace were the uprisings in Sandomierz and Starachowice.

Apparently it was one of the most secure browsers nowadays, according to his friends.\n\nBut once he loaded Twitter (now called X) he was dumbfounded. There were people such as Mateusz Morawieski fighting with Aleksandra Dulkiewicz for "betraying her country in its most vulnerable state", local people from his hometown in Ćmielów being racist towards Jews and those who just like him were confused about the whole anarchy on this platform.\n\n"Alright", said Igor to himself, "maybe other sites will be more civil". But no luck there as well. Reddit, Facebook, Wykop etc. were all filled with redheads and whatnot.

 ostrowiec.9.desc:0 ""Hello everyone. As you have certainly noticed, there have been some changes, so you have the right to expect explanations. So allow me to explain. No Polish citizen who finances the operation of public television has any obligation to listen to anyone's propaganda. Every Polish citizen who finances public media has the right to demand reliable, professional and honest information. That's why I'm offering you what I think is a fair deal. From tomorrow, Wiadomości will present you with a photograph of the world and of the day, with everything that it brings. A photograph, not a painting, because they are not the same. The painting in these studios has been painted for more than twelve years, using only carefully selected colors. And I assure you that this is coming to an end. Instead of propaganda soup, we would like to offer you clean water. Not because it is noble, but because it does not have any intrusive flavors. And I promise you that it starts now. There will be no Wiadomości today, but tomorrow we will provide you with a news program from Telewizja Polska in Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski, as always at 7:30 p.m. My name is Marek Czyż, and I cordially invite you."\n- Marek Czyż"

 ostrowiec.10.desc:0 ""Hello class. Today we will learn about the Polish Home Army.", started Milena - a history teacher in the Public Primary School no. 1 in Opatów. She knew that her job was already difficult considering the state of the system she was for so long used to. The material she had to go through didn't help as well. "As you know, it formed throughout the years after the beginning of World War 2. Its first form was present under the name of Union of Armed Struggle up until 1942."\n\nAfter this part came the hardest one - comparing its existence to Law and Justice as a fighting force against Donald Tusk. Before the Fall she was forced to spread this lie under the threat of being fired by her pro-PiS principal. But now that she died and was replaced by a apolitical candidate she could speak her mind out. "In your textbooks there is a mention that it was similiar to Law and Justice. But do you know what? It is a horrible lie made up by a vengeful old man from Żoliborz back in 2005." Then one of her students aksed "But how come? Why would they lie about this?" She wasn't quite prepared for this question but knew what to say.\n\n"You see, if you learned the TRUE history of Poland and the political landscape it was on recently, you wouldn't have to ask this. But I digress." Then Milena wrote on the whiteboard a motto which all her students would remember for the rest of their curriculum:"

But now that he disappeared without a trace his only source of intellectual evolvement were the meetings with former soldiers and humanitarian mercenaries. Today he had a chance to learn something new.\n\nPiotr Dasios, a politician-turned-soldier fought on the German-Polish front in 2027 and experienced the horrors of modern warfare. "When I arrived to the village of Węgierki (in Greater Poland) I was instructed to shoot any German present on my sight. Although the command staff didn't tell me whether I had to kill soldiers or civilians as well. But soon enough I found out the hard way."\n\nThen Piotr went on to describe the penalties he suffered when he spared the child of German origin which clearly didn't want to fight Poland. Jakub after that felt his soul leave his body briefly. He couldn't get the image of innocent people being murdered for just existing out of his head. Dasios saw this (as Jakub was sitting in the fron seat) and assured the young male that "this won't happen again... hopefully". This did little to comfort him, but gave him a false sense of hope..."

For example we can now travel faster with a plane while also emitting way less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. But that doesn't mean that all of them can be brought into life by us. After all we are still underdeveloped and any funds that could go into any sort of i.e. airport will basically be wasted. But even then some of the discoveries and improvekments are in Ostrowiec.\n\nEver since the invention of Bitcoin there was a dream that our country could stop paying in cash or coins and instead use transactions with our credit cards (or phones) only. But now we can do that - we are slowly transforming and allowing people to transfer cash into bank accounts. Another invention that came around was 6G - allowing for even faster transfer of files and greater uploading speed. As one of the only warlords in Poland we have acquired access to this technology. Which technically makes us the most advanced country in our region (and even the nation)."

In a radio address directed to the nation she expressed her gratitude to the civilians who voted for her and supported her side of the conflict. At the same time she announced new reforms which will "modernise Poland and turn it from a third-world country to a major ally of the West". However whether her plan will bring any fruits is still up for debate.\n\nIn the meantime the centrist branch of New Poland has declared secession and continues to fight against so-called "Kinga Wnuk's Madness". However with the little support from the population they don't expect to keep fighting on for long."

While many observers expected protests regarding this power change, the people seem more than content with the return of Civic Coalition.

Some thought that maybe Kinga Wnuk would continue her rule, others that liberals would take power. But what no one even dared to think actually happened - Oskar Rogowski-Bystroń won said struggle and consolidated power.\n\nKnown for being deported to Saxony back in 2024 and made into an agent thanks to likes of Morawiecki and Kaczyński, his victory caused unease in Holy Cross society. But unlike other candidates, he promised the people that their voice will be finally heard and they could directly decide about the fate of their nation. Although many outsiders criticised this move, the civilians are more than content with this development.\n\nHowever the biggest threat to Bystronite government is not his reputation but radicalised parties.

 BGF_wara_ziobro_desc:0 "Never before have we stood so united against a grave threat that is General Prosecutorship. Although this will hamper our ability to rule over our country, the bonuses in combat shall remedy it."
 BGF_a_long_road_ahead_3_desc:0 "Due to countless casualties and broken infrastructure our country is in a sorry state. We must repair everything and modernise every aspect of our lives. It is the only way to progress further (and outmaneuver our enemies)."
 BGF_a_long_road_ahead_2_desc:0 "Thanks to previous reforms we were able to revamp some of the neglected institutions of our country. However we are far from over. There are still people who are affected by the Uprising and we can't just ignore them. Thus there is still more to do."
 BGF_a_long_road_ahead_desc:0 "Due to our quick and swift actions the nation is slowly healing from the wounds of War. And yet there is still more to do. Thankfully it is by now easy to do as through previous reforms we improved our bureaucracy and now have more factories to use for this."
 BGF_computer_in_every_house_idea_desc:0 "Despite our hardships and the condition we found ourselves in, we managed to fulfill one of our promises - Computer in Every House. Now everyone has access to many forms of entertainment and information...\n\nThat is, if they have Internet, of course."
 BGF_tv_in_every_house_idea_desc:0 "Despite our hardships and the condition we found ourselves in, we managed to fulfill one of our promises - Television in Every House. Now everyone can access the same information and this, in return, will cause less conflicts in general...\n\nWait, does that count as propaganda?" # Jeszcze jak!
 BGF_AK_heritage_desc:0 "The Home Army, although failed at liberating Poland, gave an example on how every man and woman should act when they are under the threat of extinction. It also applies to our occupied territories - the future citizens will learn (either way) that they should obey us."
 BGF_NATO_heritage_desc:0 "NATO may not have lived up to its name and goal (liberation of countries), but the tactics it used to achieve its missions definitely did. Nowadays our armies look up to George W. Bush and the way he slaughtered Iraqis just because of WMDs "present" in their country."
 BGF_technology_our_future_desc:0 "As Konrad Łebek once said during an interview in Bodzechów - "If we want to ensure our superiority against our neighbours, we must develop, trade with foreign nations and invent things ourselves". With these points mentioned we began a slow but effective transition from a third-world country to a technocracy of sorts. Of course that costs us some of our civilian factories, but what did you expect from the need of evolving? Technology won't be making itself, would it?"
 BGF_polak_historyk_desc:0 "Our citizens have suffered under many regimes and wouldn't like to relive those memories. That's why they have dedicated their lives to unifying their country further instead of deepening differences between its regions. However the attention it gained is... less than ideal."

 BGF_power_struggle_idea_desc:0 "§RIt has begun...§! The internal war in order to gather enough support to get rid of political opponents. There are four possible candidates (or more if we count radicals) - centrists, lead by Oskar Rogowski; social-democrats with Kinga Wnuk as its representative; liberals under the leadership of Garbiel Kwietniak and finally the Unthinkable Candidate. All of them are partially tearing up our country, which makes it less stable and more prone to radicalisation. We must stop this process before it gets too bad."
 BGF_power_struggle_idea_horrible_desc:0 "Some time has passed. The situation in our country has somewhat stabilised but is it still far from the ideal point. Radical ideologies are still popping out left and right. The struggle is still ongoing and the people are also divided. Whatever this brings us in the long run is still in question. But we can all agree that it solely depends on who takes power in the end."
 BGF_power_struggle_idea_bad_desc:0 "Thanks to swift actions taken by all sides of the struggle the spreading of radical ideologies have been contained. But that doesn't mean that we are doing any better. Sure, there are less fights and the different candidates are trying their best to keep the facade of normalcy. But it is still clear that they are ready to catch eachother's throats and rip them away from themselves. We must pray that this madness ends soon."
 BGF_power_struggle_idea_normal_desc:0 "No one can deny the fact that our government is more stable than before. But it is still far from what most of us want. There are still posters that encourage the voters to jeopardise the elections in favor of one side. There are still arguments in our families regarding which candidate each member will choose. But thankfully it is way more peaceful than before the Fall. Perhaps soon enough we won't notice the consequences of the Power Struggle."
 BGF_power_struggle_idea_lite_desc:0 "Finally, after some time, the effects of the Power Struggle are barely noticeable in our daily lives. The electoral posters are no longer attacking other parites and just encourage people to take part in ordinary elections. It seems that, as the time progressed, everyone got over the hype of the internal fights and just want to see their country together. And that's what we want to see!"
 BGF_remove_competition_idea_desc:0 "Although Kinga Wnuk and Oskar Rogowski had known each other before, their stance on social issues and the way of governing have proven themselves to cause a schism in the 'New Poland' party. Thus we have to make sure that at least some of our friends realise how stupid the centrists are and how they want to reshape our Poland. It may be a dirty play, but considering the circumstances - it is the only way (maybe)."
 BGF_cut_social_spendings_idea_desc:0 ""If you want to rule a country, you have to be ruthless." This rule of thumb has proven useful in recent times as we started cutting state pensions such as 500+ in order to recover some of our economy. Sure, this will upset our people at first, but they will be thankful (hopefully) in the future that we managed to heal our finances."
 BGF_regulated_markets_desc:0 "In a surprising turn of events the two sides that were heavily opposed to each other have found a uniting factor (besides hatred towards Kwietniak and Wnuk) - fate of free markets. They have agreed that they are way too monopolistic and have to be regulated heavily. Although that doesn't make Freemarketists very free, its leader - Jarosław Górczyński - understands that people are already suffering under Żabkas and Biedronkas. Thus with Oskar Rogowski he implemented a law that restricts consumers from being abused and lied to.\n\nBut for some reason the people despise this. Hmm, I wonder why?"

 BGF_refugees_idea_desc:0 "Ever since Law and Justice came to power in the Holy Cross region there has been a massive influx of refugees fleeing from an oppressive regime. While we have tried our best to handle them, the sheer numbers of them have nearly paralysed [ROOT.GetName]. We must wither the storm and pray that it won't cause more troubles in the future..."
 BGF_little_technocracy_idea_desc:0 "A nation which does not develop is not worthy of existence. That's why we must improve ourselves all the time. If our enemies were to EVEN surpass us at any point we would be doomed (unless we would have more men in the field). Of course even with this advantage something still could go wrong. But by inventing new ways of combat we can limit these effects."
 BGF_plagued_with_defeatism_desc:0 "We may have united the whole voivodeship under our heel. Heck, we became a shining beacon of democracy in the middle of chaos! But even then there are things we just can't escape - one of them is defeatism. Due to amount of casualties taken by all of the sides of the conflict some of our soldiers have started to degrade in their performance and others started to avoid conscription. While we don't blame them we must "force" them to stop this act. Otherwise we will definitely fall before long. And then what?"
 BGF_polak_patriota_desc:0 "We didn't win the struggle for uniting our voivodeship by just talking to others. We had to show that we know what we're fighting for and that this cause is worth its prize. That's why in our society developed a sort-of patriotic duty of enlisting into the army. Although the equivalent number of Poles living here became defeatist, their voice is no longer as important as the patriotic one."
 BGF_major_corpo_strike_desc:0 "Due to the actions taken by our government the corporations have begun a massive strike in our biggest cities as a protest. Although this is a temporary setback it hampered our country' ability to produce anything. We'll just have to wait it out..."
 BGF_minor_corpo_strike_desc:0 "Due to the actions taken by our government the corporations have begun a strike in some of our cities as a protest. Although this is a temporary setback it somewhat hampered our country' ability to produce anything. We'll just have to wait it out..."
 BGF_better_industry_idea_desc:0 "As a part of "Economic Rejuvenation" program started by Edyta Jakubczyk our workers and constructors began massive efforts to bring back our nation from backwaters, so that we can compete with more industrialised North. That is a temporary process but it is necessary for creating groundworks for eventual war economy."
 BGF_plagued_with_corporats_desc:0 "A result of neglect and way too much trust put into corporations. Our markets have basically been monopolised which make them uncompetitive on a grand scale. If we are to solve this problem we must be prepared - these companies have gathered enough power to oppose us. Trying to limit their influence would definitely cause utter chaos and useless bloodshed."
 BGF_plagued_with_corporats_2_desc:0 "Now that we began our process of decartelisation we can notice the fruits of our hard labour. More and more small businesses are opening up and the conglomerates are forced (either by us or economic turbulences) to close their shops and factories. With grants given for the former, we can be sure that our markets will compete again."
 BGF_plagued_with_corporats_3_desc:0 "We are slowly nearing the end. The power of cartels and whatnot is minimal by now. With just one swift blow we will be able to rid ourselves of those pathetic corporations. They will no longer plague our Kowalskis and Nowaks. They will be more confident in starting businesses (also thanks to our courses on managements of firms)."
 BGF_sprawna_armia_desc:0 "We don't like boasting at all about our army size and professionalism. After all, this information could be used by some to take advantage over us. But we feel obliged to say that our forces are state-of-the-art combatants who are ready to fight for their nation. Especially after improving our infrastructure, they are also very great at moving at lighting speeds!"
